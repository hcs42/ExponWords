Practice algorithm
------------------

- implement advanced "strength/next date calculation" (strength2 = strength1 +

    - practicing selected words should use this method too
- early practice: it should ask "do you want to go on?" after finishing the
  practice
- add SuperMemo/Anki ideas
    - use special labels, e.g. "!sm2" for using SM-2 on a word pair
    - use 6 days as second interval (label "!6")
    - use easyness factor (label "!ef")
- stats about the effectiveness of the algorithm
    - percentage of YES/NO answers (per word strength)
    - retention rate (per word strength)
