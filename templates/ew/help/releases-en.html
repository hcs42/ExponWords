<h2 id="0-14">Version 0.14 (2013-08-11)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>New, smarter algorithm for strengthening words</strong> during
  practice. The old algorithm can still be used, but all existing and new
  dictionaries use the new algorithm by default. The old and new algorithms and
  the difference between them is described in the
  <a href="{% url 'help' 'en' %}#strengthener-methods">Methods of strengthening a
    word</a>
  section of the help. </li>
  <li><strong>Practice early</strong>: words can be practiced even if there are
  no words due today (by using the new "Practice early" link on a dictionary's
  page).</li>
  <li>Words and notes in the dictionaries <strong>can be formatted using the
    HTML language</strong>. For example parts of the words can be mode
  <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, and images can be inserted. The recommended way of
  starting using HTML formatting on an existing dictionary is to set the format
  of the dictionary to "HTML (keep line breaks)" in the "Modify dictionary"
  page, and then just start using HTML tags in the words and notes. More
  information and examples can be found in the <a href="{% url 'help' 'en'
    %}#text-formats">Text formats</a> section of the help. </li>
  <li>The buttons on the Practice page can be controlled with a
  <strong>presenter device</strong> (the PageUp/PageDown settings should be
  changed in Settings to enable this).</li>
  <li>The practice page has a <strong>full screen mode</strong>.</li>
  <li>The practice page has more <strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong>: M for
  showing the operations, and F for full screen mode.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-13">Version 0.13 (2012-12-10)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Word pairs <strong>can be deleted</strong> from the "Edit word pair"
  page.</li>
  <li>When a new word pair is added via the "Add new word pair" page and a
  <strong>similar word pair has already been added</strong> to the same
  dictionary, the user will be warned. Two word pairs are considered similar if
  at least of their words is the same.</li>
  <li>The "Practice page" shows <strong>quick labels</strong> (after clicking
  on the "More" button), which can be added to the current word quickly. The
  list of quick labels can be set in Settings; by default only the label called
  "quick" is a quick label.</li>
  <li>The <strong>"Practice page" will reload itself</strong> automatically if
  there are still words to be practiced.</li>
  <li>The "Practice page" will only load <strong>a maximum of 200
    words</strong> at a time.</li>
  <li>The word orderings in the "Practice page" are calculated using
  <strong>tomorrow's dimness</strong> instead of today's dimness.</li>
</ul>

  <strong>basic</strong> and an <strong>advanced view</strong>.</li>

  <a href="http://exponwords.com/">exponwords.com</a>.</li>
  <li>The names and languages of dictionaries <strong>can be
    modified</strong>.</li>

  <li>The <strong>"Practice" page</strong> shows the <strong>direction</strong>
  of the current question by printing an <strong>arrow</strong>.</li>
  <li>The front page shows the list of dictionaries in an <strong>alphabetical
    order</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-9">Version 0.9 (2011-09-15)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some things were <strong>renamed</strong>: "Action" &rarr; "operation",
  "Search" page &rarr; "Search and operations" page, "Options" &rarr;
  "Settings".</li>
  <li>The <strong>word pairs</strong> on the "Search and operations" page can
  be <strong>selected</strong> not only using the checkboxes, but by
  <strong>clicking anywhere</strong> on the <strong>word pair's row</strong>.
  The selected lines become gray.</li>
  <li>After <strong>adding a word pair</strong>, the next page will contain a
  <strong>link</strong> to the previously added word pair.</li>
  <li>You can <strong>register</strong> an account, change your password and
  reset it in case you have forgotten it.</li>
  <li>On the "Settings" page, the <strong>time zone</strong> and the
  <strong>turning point</strong> can be set besides the language. (The turning
  point is the time of the day when ExponWords will start asking the words of
  that day.)</li>
  <li>You can set your <strong>email address</strong> and <strong>whether you
    would like to receive emails</strong> about new features.</li>
  <li>You can choose between <strong>two arrangements</strong> for the
  <strong>"Practice" page</strong> and you can <strong>set the size</strong> of
  the buttons and text too.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-8">Version 0.8 (2011-08-28)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>"Practice" page</strong> can be used with <strong>keyboard
    shortcuts</strong>:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>pressing any key is equivalent to clicking on the "ANSWER" button;</li>
    <li>pressing the "Y" or "I" key is equivalent to clicking on the "YES"
    button;</li>
    <li>pressing the "N" key is equivalent to clicking on the "NO" button.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Listing the hits</strong> can be <strong>turned off</strong> on
  the <strong>"Search" page</strong>. This is useful if you want to do the same
  operation on hundreds of word pairs (e.g. shift their dates), but the web
  browser would be too slow because of the large page or you want to spare your
  network usage.</li>
  <li><strong>Labels</strong> can be specified when <strong>importing word
    pairs</strong>; these labels will be added to the words.</li>
  <li>The <strong>"Show my future"</strong> page (available from the front
  page) was created that draws a <strong>graph</strong> displaying a prediction
  about the number of words that will be asked each day in the next two
  months.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-7">Version 0.7 (2011-08-10)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>word pairs selected</strong> in the "Search" page <strong>can
    be practiced</strong>. You can choose either practicing all the selected
  words, or only those that are due.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-6">Version 0.6 (2011-07-30)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On the <strong>"Search" page</strong>, the dates and strength of the
  selected word pairs can be <strong>modified at once</strong>, and also labels
  can be added, removed and modified at once.</li>
  <li>When a new word pair is added, ExponWords <strong>remembers</strong> the
  <strong>initial dates, strengths and labels</strong>. This way if several
  word pairs are to be added e.g. with the same label, the label has to be
  typed only for the first word pair; it will already be present in the form
  for the rest of the word pairs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-5">Version 0.5 (2011-07-11)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Moving word pairs</strong> (available from "Search page"):
  Multiple word pairs can be moved to another dictionary.</li>
  <li><strong>Shift dates</strong> (available from "Search page"): The dates of
  the word pairs (based on which the program decides when to ask the word pair)
  can be shifted with the number of given days. For example if 3 days is typed,
  then a word which would otherwise be asked on 1st January will be asked only
  on 4th January. Negative numbers can also be specified: in this case the
  dates will be changed to earlier ones. This can be useful if you did not have
  time to practice for a week, but do not want all the words due to be asked on
  the first day. Using this feature, ExponWords can act as if that one week did
  not exists.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-4">Version 0.4 (2011-06-27)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Labels</strong> can be assigned to word pairs when editing them
  (a word pair may have several labels). They can be used to organize the
  dictionaries.</li>
  <li>The new <strong>"Search" page</strong> (which can be opened either from
  the main page or the pages of the dictionaries) allows us to search among the
  word pairs. The dictionary and the label to be searched can be selected.</li>
  <li><strong>Negative strengths</strong> can be used. For example if -2 is
  set, then the word will be asked today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and
  only then will the frequency decrease.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-3">Version 0.3 (2011-03-20)</h2>
<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code released under GPLv3 (as <strong>open source</strong>
  software).</li>
  <li><strong>"(Help)" links</strong> on more pages.</li>
  <li><strong>"Select all" button</strong> added to the "View" page.</li>
  <li>Better user experience during practice sessions with bad <strong>network
    connections</strong> (the timeouts in the client were increased).</li>
  <li><strong>FAQ</strong> translated to English help pages. (It was already
  present on the Hungarian help page.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-2">Version 0.2 (2011-03-13)</h2>

<p>New in this release:</p>
<ul>

  framework.</li>

  <strong>can be changed</strong>.</li>
  <li>Word pairs can be <strong>deleted</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>date of addition</strong> is stored for each word pair.</li>
  <li>The "Practice" page displays a <strong>link to the previous word</strong>
  (it can be useful if you realize that you did not actually know a word just
  after pressing "YES"; this way you can easy edit the word's strength).</li>
  <li>Better user interface, e.g. <strong>menus</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="0-1">Version 0.1 (2011-02-13)</h2>

<p>The first release of ExponWords had the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Word pairs</strong> can be added and edited.</li>
